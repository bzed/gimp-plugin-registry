<title>DBP - David's Batch Processor</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p><b>DBP</b> <i>(David's Batch Processor)</i> is a simple batch processing
plugin for the Gimp - it allows the user to automatically perform operations (such
as resize) on a collection of image files. Its main advantage is that the user
does not have to learn a scripting language. Like the Gimp itself, DBP
relies on a graphical interface. 
The user creates a list of images, and sets up the processing required for
each image. The results of the current settings can be displayed. Once the
required sequence of operations has been set up,
DBP performs the same processing on each image in turn.
The images can be colour corrected, resized, cropped, and sharpened, then
renamed and saved to a different file in a specified image format. All
the steps (except loading and saving the image!) are optional; so the simplest
use of DBP is just to convert a number of image files from one format
to another.</p>
<p>Note that DBP is intended for RGB, not indexed images. Trying to process
an indexed image will probably just cause an error, and DBP will halt.
Also, DBP will <b>not</b> overwrite
the original image (in fact, it should not overwrite any file) - images must at least
be either renamed (possibly by changing the image format) or moved to a different
directory.</p>
<h1>Where do I get it?</h1>
<p>
DBP is licensed under the GPL.
The latest version, described on this page, is 1.1.5. It requires Gimp 2.2
or later, and has been updated to remove all deprecated Gtk and Gimp
features (I think). It should also work with the development version
of Gimp, up to at least 2.3.7. The source is available at
<a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbpSrc-1-1-5.tgz"
>http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbpSrc-1-1-5.tgz</a>.
<br/>If you have problems with the latest version, an older version is still
available at
<a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbpSrc-1.1.1.tgz"
>http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbpSrc-1.1.1.tgz (version 1.1.1)</a>.
<br/>If you are still running Gimp 2.0, you will need version 1.0.3, at
<a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbpSrc-13-Nov-2004.tgz"
>http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbpSrc-13-Nov-2004.tgz</a>.
<br/>There is no configure file, use <b>make</b> to build and install
in your local gimp plugins directory. You will need g++ and the gimp-devel
packages for the appropriate Gimp version - if you can compile C++ and
can build any other Gimp plugin, you should have no problems.
The Makefiles are very primitive and can be edited directly if needed.
<br/>Michael Schumacher has kindly provided me with the following Win32 binary versions:

<br/>1.1.3: <a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbp-1.1.3.zip"
>http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbp-1.1.3.zip</a>
<br/>and 1.0.3: <a href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hodsond/dbp-1.0.3.zip"

<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<img src="dbp-main.png" alt="Main window"/>
<p>From the <i>Xtns</i> menu in the main Gimp window, select <b>Batch Process...</b>
to bring up the DBP window. The top section lets you set up the processing
steps; the bottom section starts and stops the processing, and shows
its progress. Note that some of the controls are inactive; DBP disables controls
which currently have no effect.</p>
<p>The processing steps
are laid out on a series of pages, one for each step.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> start at the <b>Input</b> page and set up each one in order.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> use the <b>Test</b> button to see the effect of the
processing.
<br/><i>ToDo:</i> need to see which steps are enabled without having to
go to their page.
<br/><i>ToDo:</i> save and load processing settings.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>DBP starts with the <b>Input</b> page open.
The <b>Input</b> page is used to specify the images to process. The
<b>Add Files</b> button raises a standard GTK+-2 file selector. Note that
you can select multiple files, using shift-click to select a range of files,
and control-click to select and deselect individual files. Note also that
the input files can be in different image formats. (However, they should
all have different names when the file extension is removed.)
<br/><img src="dbp-fileSelector.png">
<br/>The <b>Open</b> button adds the selected files to the input list
and closes the file selector.
The <b>Add</b> button adds the
selected files to the list and clears the selection, but does not close
the dialog, so that you can add files from other directories. <b>Close</b>
simply closes the file selector without adding any more files.
Once the
file selector is closed, the file list can be edited by selecting
one or more entries and using the <b>Remove Files</b> button to
remove them, by using <b>Clear List</b> to clear the list completely.
You can add more files by pressing <b>Add Files</b> to reopen the
file selector.
<br/><i>Note:</i> the file selector is modal, so you must close it before
you can adjust any controls in the main window.
<br/><i>ToDo:</i> save and load input lists.</p>
<h2>Processing</h2>
<p>The next pages control the processing. Each page starts with an
<b>Enable</b> toggle, which turns on the image operation for that
page and lets you set the controls. To see the effect of all the
active operations (on the first image in the file list) at any
time, press the <b>Test</b> button. The operations are applied to
the images in the order shown on the pages.
<h3>Turn</h3>
<p>If enabled, rotates the image through 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
<h3>Blur</h3>
<p>If enabled, blurs the image.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> uses <b>Gauss IIR</b>.</p>
<h3>Colour</h3>
<p>If enabled, adjusts brightness and contrast of the image, either
through the Gimp Auto Levels function, or by the control settings. The
image saturation can be adjusted, and the image can be converted to black
and white (although the image Mode will still be RGB, not Grayscale).
<br/><i>Note:</i> converting to black and white does not give the same
result as reducing the saturation to zero.
<br/><i>ToDo:</i> add gamma control.</p>
<h3>Resize</h3>
<p>If enabled, resizes the image. Resizing can be either relative to the
input image size, or to an absolute target size. Fixing the aspect ratio
of a relative resize locks the x and y sliders to the same value. There are
four options for an absolute resize. <b>Exact</b> will change the aspect
ratio of the image, if necessary, to fit the target size. <b>Pad</b> fits
the resized image inside the target size, then pads it to fit. <b>Inside</b>
creates the largest image which fits inside the target size, <b>Outside</b>
the smallest which fits outside.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> padding uses the Gimp's current background colour.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> resize uses the Gimp's <b>Interpolation Type</b> settings.
<h3>Crop</h3>
<p>If enabled, crops a region from the image.
<br/><i>Warning:</i> The region must be contained within the image area.</p>
<h3>Sharpen</h3>
<p>If enabled, sharpens the image.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> uses <b>Unsharp Mask</b>.</p>
<h2>Rename</h2>
<p>Sets the directory and file name to use when saving the processed image.
<b>Source Dir</b> refers
to the directory containing the original image. If another directory is
chosen, the image will be saved there instead. The original file name
can have a prefix or postfix added; its extension will be replaced by
the appropriate extension for the image format chosen on the next page.
An example of the renaming is shown (using an imaginary extension).
<br/><i>Hint:</i> DBP will <b>not</b> overwrite an existing file. The output
file must be renamed, have its extension changed, or be put into a different
directory.
<br/><i>ToDo:</i> add relative directory path.</p>
<p>Also includes a toggle to flatten the image before saving, which will
mostly just remove the alpha channel. This doesn't really belong here, but
I needed this for a job and didn't want to add a new control page.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Selects the image format for the processed file (and therefore its
extension). Appropriate extra controls will appear for different formats.
<br/><i>Warning:</i> The format selection may include output formats that
are not installed on your system.
<br/><i>ToDo:</i> fix that.</p>
<h2>Common Controls</h2>
<p>The <b>Test</b> button processes and displays, but does not save, the
first image in the file list. Use this to adjust the settings.
Once all the controls have been set as desired, click the <b>Start</b> button.
DBP will process each file in the file list. If <b>Show Images</b> is pressed,
then the images will be displayed as they are being processed.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> if any process fails, the entire sequence will finish.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> the <b>Cancel</b> button will not respond until the current
processing step finishes.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> cancelling any of the processing steps (from the Gimp's popup
window for that step) will cancel processing.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> DBP <b>will not</b> overwrite existing images. If you cancel
(or decide to repeat) a sequence you will need to delete any output images
before starting again.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> the image displays are managed by DBP. Do not draw on, close,
or save from them.
<br/><i>Hint:</i> untoggling the <b>Show Images</b> button, or quitting DBP,
will remove a leftover display.
<br/><i>ToDo:</i> use separate thread for processing (don't lock up user interface).
<br/><i>ToDo:</i> improve processing feedback.
<br/><i>ToDo:</i> improve error reporting (what error reporting?)</p>
