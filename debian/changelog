gimp-plugin-registry (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New plugins:
    - Separate+ (Closes: #466235)
  * debian/rules:
    - Using -O2 -fno-tree-pre instead of -O1 now, as suggested in #484569.
  * debian/patches:
    - Adding separate+_makefile_flags.diff to replace LDFLAGS/CFLAGS in the
      separate+ Makefile.
  * debian/control:
    - Adding liblcms1-dev and libtiff4-dev as build-dep.
  * debian/watch:
    - Adding file as recommended by lintian, contains comments only, telling
      to use 'tools.mk watch' instead of uscan, as there is no upstream for
      this package.

gimp-plugin-registry (0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Bernd Zeimetz <bzed@debian.org>  Thu, 05 Jun 2008 11:32:29 +0200

gimp-plugin-registry (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updating the plugins' url files to follow the new registry.gimp.org
    structure.
  * debian/rules:
    - Updating watch/update-watch targets to retrieve the 'submitted' date
      from registry.gimp.org pages.
    - Splitting out tools.mk as we need watch/update-watch it in the
      'plugins' branch in git.
    - Removing the build-tgz target - this is done by git-buildpackage now.
    - Switching from dpatch to quilt as patch-system. This also includes minor
      changes in debian/patches.
    - Using -O1 on amd64 instead of -O2 as g++ 4.3 gets stuck in an endless
      loop with -O2. See #484569 for details.
  * debian/patches:
    - Adding and refreshing several patches to integrate the plugins better
      into the menu structure of GIMP.
    - Adding bw-simulation-color-mixer-fix.diff to fix a bug in the
      bw-simulation plugin: plug-in-colors-channel-mixer takes 13 args only,
      not 16. Thanks to Klaus Ethgen for the report (Closes: #453883).
  * debian/control:
    - Updating Vcs-* to point to the new Git repository.
    - Replacing the dpatch build-dep by quilt.
    - Adding gimp-python and python as dependency.
    - Updating requiered gimp version to 2.4.0

  * New upstream versions of the following plugins:
    - GREYCstoration
    - David's Batch Processor
    - Focus-blur

  * New plugins:
    - Wavelet Denoise (Closes: #481413)
    - Diana2-Holga
    - Add Filmgrain
    - Contact Sheet
    - Save for Web

  * Removing the 'dustcleaner' plugin for now.
    It is imho not mature enough to be part of a stable release.

      (Closes: #463950).

    - Adding gcc4.3-fixes.dpatch to fix building with gcc 4.3
      (Closes: #456054).

      adding a version requirement for libgimp2.0-dev.

 -- Bernd Zeimetz <bzed@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Jan 2008 11:29:56 +0100

gimp-plugin-registry (0.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Checking if we need to update debian/copyright or debian/control in the
      clean target now as a check by the build target does not work when using
      svn-buildpackage. Also monitor debian/{copyright,control}.in for
      changes.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Adding Vcs-* fields here instead of debian/control so we don't lose them
      again. Thanks to Thijs Kinkhorst for the hint.
    - Adding fftw3-dev to Build-Depends, needed by the new focus-blur version.
  * layer-effects:
    - Updating version number to 2.4 to follow upstream - no changes in the
      plugin, though.
  * focus-blur:
    - New upstream version

gimp-plugin-registry (0.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release of the lqr plugin which disables debug code the
    author accidentally left enabled in the last release. The debug code
    introduced a bug ironically.

 -- Bernd Zeimetz <bernd@bzed.de>  Thu, 18 Oct 2007 10:31:33 +0200

gimp-plugin-registry (0.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't use dh_install to copy documentation files as some of them are
    symlinks - dh_install doesn't dereference symlinks. Thanks to
    Christian Ohm for the report. (Closes: #447017)
  * debian/control:
    - Adding Vcs-{Browser,Svn} fields.
    - Removing autotools and automake Build-Dep, we're building refocus
      without autotools.
  * New upstream version of lqr.

 -- Bernd Zeimetz <bernd@bzed.de>  Wed, 17 Oct 2007 23:26:49 +0200

gimp-plugin-registry (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adding extra checks to ensure that the debian/{copyright,control} were
    updated after modifying the description/version/copyright files in the
    plugin directories.
  * Modifying the update-description target to include version informations
    which are provided in the plugin directories now. Thanks to Nelson A. de
    Oliveira for the suggestion (Closes: #444591).
  * Enhancing common-autotools.mk to be able to build the Refocus plugin
    which needs some extra love due to a bit buggy build system.
  * New plugins:
    - Refocus (transition from gimp-refocus), also including a bugfix which
      was reported against the former package. The plugin needs some extra
      build-dependencies which were added.
    - Smart-Sharpen-Redux
    - Exposure Blend, thanks to Jurij Smakov  for the suggestion
      (Closes: #446507)

  * lqr:
    - New plugin. Thanks to Ari Pollak for the hint.
  * DBP:
    - New upstream version.

      menu structure of gimp

  * fix-ca:
