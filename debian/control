Description: A repository of optional extensions for The GIMP
 The package contains the following plugins:
 .
   * Add Film Grain (2.4):
     Helps adding realistic film grain to BW images.
   * btn4ws (0.8.0.1):
     Generates a series of buttons in three states (passive, active, pressed)
     with various selectable effects on them, as well as XHTML, CSS and
     JavaScript code for using the buttons.
   * Black and White Film Simulation (1.1):
     Converts the selected layer into Black and White using
     the channel mixer. Tries to produce results resembling
     tonal qualities of film.
   * Contact Sheet:
     Generates a contact sheet(s) for a directory of images.
   * David's Batch Processor (1.1.9):
     A simple batch processing plugin for The Gimp - it allows
     the user to automatically perform operations (such as resize)
     on a collection of image files.
   * Diana-Holga2 (c):
     Diana/Holga Toys Cameras effect simulator.
   * Dustcleaner (r7):
     Plugin to detect and remove dust spots in digital images.
   * Fix-CA (3.0.2):
     Corrects chromatic aberration in photos
   * Focus-Blur (3.2.4):
     This plugin tries to simulate an out-of-focus blur
   * GREYCstoration (2.9):
     A tool to denoise, inpaint and resize images
   * Layer-Effects (2.4):
     This is a series of scripts that implement various layer effects:
     Drop Shadow, Inner Shadow, Outer Glow, Inner Glow, Bevel and Emboss,
     Satin, Color Overlay, Gradient Overlay, Pattern Overlay, Stroke
   * Liquid Rescale (0.6.1):
     Content-aware rescaling. Keeps the features of the image while
     rescaling along a single direction.
   * Normalmap (1.2.2):
     Allows you to convert images into RGB normal maps for use in
     per-pixel lighting applications.
   * Planet Render (1-2):
     Creates a planet. Color, size and sun orientation
     can be set.
   * Refocus (0.9.1):
     The GIMP plugin to refocus images using FIR Wiener filtering.
     During image processing operations such as scanning and scaling, images
     tend to get blurry. The blurred impression of these images is due to the
     fact that image pixels are averaged with their neighbors. Blurred images
     don't have sharp boundaries and look as though they have been taken with
     an unfocussed camera.
   * Save for Web (0.28.5):
     Allows to experiment with various popular web format options. It shows
     an automatically updated preview and file size statistics.
   * Separate+ (0.5.3):
     Separate+ is a plug-in that generates color separations from an RGB
     image, proofs CMYK colors on the monitor and exports the CMYK TIFF file.
   * Smart Sharpen (redux) (2.4):
     This script implements the redux version of smart sharpening. It utilizes
     the Unsharp Mask or Refocus plugin to sharpen the image.
   * Sprocket Hole Script (0.2):
     This script simulates complete exposed 35mm film strips with frame
     numbers, lettering, overexposed sprocketholes and DX film edge barcodes.
   * Streak-Camera simulation (0.6):
     A streak camera images an object through a slit -
     thus getting a "one dimensional image". This image is
     propagated along the second dimension of the image plane
     at a constant speed. The result is a picture of the time
     dependency of the object.
   * Wavelet Denoise (0.2-beta):
     The wavelet denoise plugin is a tool to selectively reduce noise in
     individual channels of an image with optional RGB<->YCbCr conversion.
     It has a user inteface to adjust the amount of denoising applied. The
     wavelet nature of the algorithm makes the processing quite fast.
