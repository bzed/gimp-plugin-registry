INSTALL
=======

For Linux and Unix users
------------------------
To install this GIMP plugin simply state

	make
	make install

for a system wide installation (with root privileges) or

	make
	make userinstall

for a user installation. A restart of The GIMP is recommended.

Other platforms
---------------
I'm sorry I have no knowledge on how to install plugins on other platforms. I
hope others will find a way.
