Requirements
=======================================

The only required packages that must be installed to build the plugin
(besides Gtk+ and the GIMP) are:
  
  1) gimp version 2.4 or later
  2) pkg-config version 0.14 or later
  3) gtkglext version 0.7.1 or later
  4) GLEW version 1.3.3 or later
    
You will need to install the development packages for your distribution for
Gtk+, Glib, gtkglext, GLEW and GIMP.

Building a plugin for Windows
=======================================

To build a plugin for the Windows version of GIMP, you'll need to use a
MinGW environment (http://www.mingw.org) and install the development
and runtime packages for the following libraries:

   1) GIMP 2.4.x
   2) glib2
   3) gtk+2
   4) pango
   5) atk
   6) pkg-config
   7) gtkglext
   8) GLEW
   
To build, type "make WIN32=1".
  
Installation
=======================================

1. Type 'make' to build the plugin
2. Type 'make install' to install the plugin. By default the plugin will be
installed in your GIMP user plugin directory ($HOME/.gimp-2.2/plug-ins).  If
you want to install the plugin system-wide, as root you must manually copy the
plugin to the system GIMP plugin directory.
