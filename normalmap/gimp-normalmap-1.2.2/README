GIMP normalmap plugin
(C) 2002-2008 Shawn Kirst <skirst@insightbb.com>
==========================================

This is a plugin for GIMP version 2.4.x. It allows you to convert images into
RGB normal maps for use in per-pixel lighting applications. The goal is to
completely clone NVIDIA's photoshop plugin, with a few new useful features.

Features
==========================================
* Filters. These include the filters found in the NVIDIA plugin (4
sample, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 and 9x9) with the addition of a 3x3 sobel and a 3x3
prewitt filter (yields the best results IMO).
* Post-filtering normal scaling
* Wrap mode. This allows the filters to wrap around the image.
Useful for creating normalmaps from a tiling bumpmap.
* Height source. Use an average of the RGB components or the alpha
channel as the height source in the generation of the normals.
* Alpha result. For RGBA images, the alpha channel can either remain
unchanged, have the height used to generate the normal written to it, be
replaced by either 0 or 1, or the value of a grayscale image.
* Dynamic 2D preview in the interactive dialog.
* Dynamic 3D preview window with the normalmap applied to a lit primitive
* Parallax bump mapping for 3D preview
    
Planned features
==========================================    
* Support gray and gray-alpha images.
