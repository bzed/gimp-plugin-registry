   * Wavelet Denoise {version}:
     The wavelet denoise plugin is a tool to selectively reduce noise in
     individual channels of an image with optional RGB<->YCbCr conversion.
     It has a user inteface to adjust the amount of denoising applied. The
     wavelet nature of the algorithm makes the processing quite fast.
